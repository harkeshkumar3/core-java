        SPACE-TIME TRADE-OFF     AND Efficiency
        - Trade-off between memory use and Runtime performance
        - Space efficiency and time efficiency reach at two opposite ends
        - the more time efficiency you have ,the less space efficiency you have or vice versa
                - eg-> merge sort and bubble sort
